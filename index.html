              Silver Dairy was purchased by Jason Smith in 2009. 
              His passion for serving others motivated him to create 
              a local Farmington staple centered around families and 
              great customer service. Silver Dairy has become a place 
              where people from all over the Farmington area can meet 
              'to take a break from the business of the world and enjoy 
              a delicious treat.
              <br><br>
              Our menu is varied and the service is unmatched. If 
              you're looking for a fun and enjoyable Farmington

            <p>
              The Silver Dairy has been a staple in the Farmington 
              community for many years.  Jason Smith bought this 
              business in 2009 with one goal in mind: providing 
              delicious ice cream and outstanding customer service 
              to the greater Farmington area. Thanks to our 
              experience and dedication, we've managed to serve 
              our loyal customers for many years. Providing tasty 
              classic and new menu items, supporting local schools, 
              and adapting to the times, we'd like to say that we've 
              become a Farmington favorite.
